This is just for me to write and dump all my projects I consider to be 'beginner' projects.
This should include projects I make for school and for the sake of learning. It may even include projects I try to sell, or personal projects I make for my own use.
I know lots of people believe code should be beautiful, but I believe one cannot learn to write beautiful code without first writing a bunch of ugly and difficult to read garbage.
That is probably what this is going to be.
